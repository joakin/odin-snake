- [x] Add highscore
- [ ] Make the snake move smoothly: You can still be on grid but move each part
      smoothly to the next cell. Might be tricky to make 'feel good'. _hard_
- [ ] Add controller support: see rl.IsGamepadButtonPressed _easy_
- [ ] Add music: see rl.PlayMusicStream _medium_
- [ ] Add screen shake when you crash and eat food: you can use target on
      rl.Camera2D. You'll probably need a timer to track for how long the shake
      should happen _medium_
